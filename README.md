## KaeMarks:
**Rails application that allows users to bookmark URLs by email,
 check out other users' bookmarks and keep an index of categorized bookmarks.**

>Wouldn't you also like the ability to share bookmarks with friends? That is not something you can do easily from your native browser.

>Blocmarks will solve these problems by organizing bookmarks by topic and making them public so that other users can find them and add bookmarks to their own Blocmarks profile.

 Made with my mentor at [Bloc](http://bloc.io).
